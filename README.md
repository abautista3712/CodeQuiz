CodeQuiz is an interactive web application made to test the user's knowledge of world capitals. Ten questions are presented to the user each with four selectable answers. Three of the four options are incorrect and will provide user feedback that the option is wrong if selected. A correct answer will advance the quiz to the next question. The quiz is timed and will end if the timer ends or if ten questions have been answered correctly. A highscore table is presented at the end of the quiz. CodeQuiz is hosted on GitHub and is designed to be mobile responsive.
